<h1>HeartRateMonitor</h1>
An application to measure the heart rate of an individual. Uses a very rudimentary image processing algorithm to measure changes in red values from the camera and takes a running average of the color to attempt to predict when the heart beats.
The application is in beta stage and will soon be updated with the ability to
track historical heart rates.
